### Investigations

- Compare cornavirus with influenza using sequence alignment with Needleman–Wunsch algorithm.
- Compare Covid-19 with SARS-1

### Definitions

- A _genome_ is all of an organism's DNA sequence
- Replication is the process of duplicating the genome when a cell divides.
- A _DNA sequence_ contains only the letters A, C, G and T. (Each letter represents a small molecule, and a DNA sequence is a ``macromolecular'' chain of them.)
  - A adenine
  - C cytosine
  - G guanine
  - T thymine
- Each letter in a DNA sequence is called a _base, basepair, or nucleotide_
- _The reverse complement_ of a DNA sequence is formed by reversing the letters, interchanging A and T and interchanging C and G. Thus the reverse complement of ACCTGAG is CTCAGGT.
